# Learn Scalaz
Learn functional programming using Scalaz! 

# About this book
This book is an introduction to functional programming using Scalaz. To read this book, you need to be familiar with Scala syntax, but hopefully, you won't need to know functional programming. 
Many concepts are tought through examples and exercises. So, It's highly recommended that you work through the exercises.

# Why I wrote it 
I've always admired Scalaz, I wondered whether it's possible to use it in real world, in real problems. But when I tried using Scalaz in my small projects, I found that it's somehow assumed that if you want to use Scalaz, you know functional programming very well (and a little Category theory ofcourse), but if your'e not used to functional programming and it's terminology, your'e stuck. Learing resources are limited to a few video presentatinos and a few blogs (Eugene Yokota's blog is awesome). And it's how I got the idea of writing a small handbook to help others that want to use Scalaz.

# A Quick look
This is a work in progress, chapters zero and one are ready at this time.
## List of chapters
* Since Scala implicits are widely used throughout the book, [chapter zero](ch00_implicits.md) covers this concept (feel free to skip it if you feel confident in using implicits)
* [chapter one](ch01.md) introduces Typeclasses and Scalaz
