# Chapter 1: Introduction
Before we begin with Scalaz, we need to learn some base concepts that help us through our journey. These concepts are independent of Scalaz and you may face them across various languages and libraries. Some even root in other FP languages specially Haskell.

## Typeclass
A `Typeclass` is a tool that helps us to define a common behaviour (feature) for a variety of types. In scala, we usualy define a typeclass as a generic trait :
```
trait StringMaker[T] {
  def makeString(t: T): String
}
```
In this example, `StringMake` is a __TypeClass__, defined on type `T` and knows how to turn `t`s into strings. In anthor words, an instance of `StringMaker[X]` adds `makeString` behaviour to `x`s.
For example if we want to have an instance of `StringMaker[Int]` we can defined it as :
```
val intStringMaker = new StringMaker[Int]{ 
  def makeString(t: Int): String = t.toString 
} 
```
At this point,you may say to yourself that `StringMaker` and `TypeClasses` are nothing but useless! And you're right since Scala has it's built-in `toString` defined in almost every object. But read on and you'll see the magic.

[Cats Documentation](https://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses.html) defines `Typeclasses` as :
```
Type classes are a powerful tool used in functional programming to enable ad-hoc polymorphism, more commonly known as overloading. Where many object-oriented languages leverage subtyping for polymorphic code, functional programming tends towards a combination of parametric polymorphism (think type parameters, like Java generics) and ad-hoc polymorphism.

```
These definitions and concepts may sound vague or obscure, so let's see some examples of typeclass.
