# Chapter 2: Basic algebraic structures
In chapter one we leared about TypeClasses, now we'll see what we can do with them. From this chapter on, we will learn some algebraic structure that are easy to learn and gives us a basic understanding about algebraic structures.

# Semigroup
Semigroup is the one of the most simple algebraic structure that we'll work with. Since we don't want to delve into `Category Theory`, it's suffice to say that most of these algebraic structure (especially the ones with strange names like SEMIGROUP!!!) are borrowed from `Category Theory`.

Mathematically speaking, a `Semigroup` is a structure that has an associative operation function with signature `(T, T) => T`. 
Associativity means that changing order of parathesis must not affect the result, for example `+` and `*` are associative, : `(a + b) + c == a + (b + c) == a + b + c`. but `-` is not.

Ok, it's a little threatening, so let's speak in our own language!

```SCALA
trait Semigroup[T] {
    def operation(left: T, right: T): T
}
```
This is the TypeClass for semigroup. it has a binary function (with two parameters). Note that the `operation` should be associative, but at this moment there is no way to guaranty associativity at the compile time (at least not that I know of) and it's our duty to ensure it with design and tests.

Let's implement a few `Semigroup`s to make it clear.
```SCALA
  implicit val intMulSemigroup = new Semigroup[Int] {
    def operation(left: Int, right: Int): Int = left * right
  }

  implicit val stringSemigroup = new Semigroup[String] {
    def operation(left: String, right: String): String = left + right
  }

  type IntVector = (Int, Int)
  implicit val intVectorSemigroup = new Semigroup[IntVector] {
    def operation(left: IntVector, right: IntVector): IntVector =
      (left._1 + right._1, left._2 + right._2)
  }
```
I think everything is more clear now. Note that Semigroup is a TypeClass and these are some instances. Can you implement _Syntax_ and _Ops_ classes for `Semigroup` to make it easier to use ?
```SCALA
// Exercise 2.1: Implement Syntax and Ops classes for Semigroup so that you can test it like this:
  "SemigroupSyntax" should "provide an easy way to combine values" in {
    import SemigroupSyntax._
    import BasicSemigroupInstances._

    2 <> 3 shouldBe 6
    "Hello" <> " " <> "World!" shouldBe "Hello World!"
    (1, 1) <> (2, 3) shouldBe (3, 4)
  }
```
