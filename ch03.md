# Chapter 3: Monoid
Now that we're equipped with Semigroups, defining what a Monoid is, would be rather easy. 
## Definition
In functional programming, Monoid is a Semigroup with an identity element. Let me explain that. Earlier, we learned that a Semigroup is an algebraic structure with an associative binary operation. To form a Monoid, we need that, plus an identity element that is neutral to that operation, which means that combining any element of the set with the identity elemnt, results in that element. For example, the type Int forms a Semigroup with `+` as the operator. To form a Monoid we need an identity element so that if we add any element `x` with the identity element, it results in the `x` itself, So here our identity element would be `0`! 

To make sure that we're on the same page, let's solve a few problems first and then we'll see the code! For any of the following samples, try to find the identity element. Remember, to form a Monoid, we need a set (or a type) , an associative binary operation and an identidy element.
1. Set: Strings  operator: +
2. Set: Ints    operator: *
3. Set: Positive integers  operator: max
4. Set: Vectors (tuples of int)  operator: +

Since it's not that hard, the answer to the above questions is: "", 1, 1 , (0,0).
Number four is a bit tricky, isn't it? can you say why the answer is the minimum number in the set ?

## Monoid typeclass
Remember that we defined the Semigroup TypeClass as :
```SCALA
trait Semigroup[T] {
    def combine(left: T, right: T): T
}
```
Now we defined Monoid as:
```SCALA
trait Monoid[T] extends Semigroup[T] {
    def zero: T
}
```
Note that here `zero` is another name for `identity` element. The identity element has different names in various texts and libraries. For example it's called `empty` in Cats and `zero` in scalaz, So since we don't want to use the name `identity` to shadow scala's `identity` function, we use the term `zero` from now on. 
```SCALA
  implicit val intMonoid : Monoid[Int] = new Monoid[Int] {
    override def zero: Int = 0
    override def combine(left: Int, right: Int): Int = left + right
  }

  implicit val stringMonoid: Monoid[String] = new Monoid[String] {
    override def zero: String = ""
    override def combine(left: String, right: String): String = left + right
  }
```

Easy, right? Now, let's try to write a Monoid for `Option[T]` !
```SCALA
def optionMonoid[T: Monoid]: Monoid[Option[T]] = new Monoid[Option[T]] {
    import samples.ch02.SemigroupSyntax._

    override def zero: Option[T] = implicitly[Monoid[T]].zero.some
    override def combine(left: Option[T], right: Option[T]): Option[T] = {
      (left, right) match {
        case (Some(l), Some(r)) => (l |+| r).some
        case (l: Some[T], None) => l
        case (None, r: Some[T]) => r
        case (None, None)       => none[T]
      }
    }
  }
```

First, if you can remember how we implemented Semigroup for option, you'll noticed that we used another implementation of combine here. Note that there's no difference between implementing the combine function for any Semigroup or Monoid. I just wanted to show that we can have many Semigroups defined for any type (as long as they respect the laws of Semigroups).

Another thing that instead of re-using the implementation of combine for option, we implemented it again, that's not very functional of us !! The essence of Functional Programming and Category Theory is composition, we need to define our definitions in a way that we can re-use them at will.

To achieve this level of composition, we can use a trick like this:

First we define our instance of `Semigroup[Option[T]]` as a class (instead of implicit val like chapter 2)
```SCALA
class OptionSemigroup[T: Semigroup] extends Semigroup[Option[T]] {
  import samples.ch02.SemigroupSyntax._
  override def combine(left: Option[T], right: Option[T]): Option[T] = {
    (left, right) match {
      case (Some(l), Some(r)) => (l |+| r).some
      case (l: Some[T], None) => l
      case (None, r: Some[T]) => r
      case (None, None)       => none[T]
    }
  }
}
```
Now we can re-use this definition in our Monoid instance:
```SCALA
class OptionMonoid[T: Monoid] extends OptionSemigroup[T] with Monoid[Option[T]]{
  override def zero: Option[T] = implicitly[Monoid[T]].zero.some
}
```
And finaly to make a clean and easy to use structure, we gather all the implementations of our algebraic structures for option in a single place:
```SCALA
object OptionInstances {
  implicit def monoid[T: Monoid] = new OptionMonoid[T]
}
```
which currently only supports monoid and semigroup (don't see the instance for semigroup ? :D). And now we just need to import `OptionInstances.monoid`.
